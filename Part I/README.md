# Section I: Road recognition (_Where am I heading?_) ðŸ›£

## Topics
### L01: Basics of image manipulation
**OpenCV** is a free library originally developed by Intel. It saw the light of day in 1999. Originally written in C/C++, its best virtue is that it is cross-platform, it can run on different operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, Android and iOS). It can also be used in different programming languages such as Java, Objective C, C# and **Python**.

It is perhaps the most important and most widely used computer vision library. It is used by universities, companies and people in the Maker movement to give free rein to their imagination as it is free software.

In this notebook we will start with image processing in Python using this library, more specifically we will see how to load or read an image, conversion to black and white, filters and other operations that will be useful in the course.

### L02: Region of interest and direction algorithm
In this lesson we will apply **`OpenCV`** functions to perform the reading of a video, as well as selecting and displaying the region of interest of a road. Finally, the steering algorithm will be shown.
