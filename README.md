# Self-Driving Cars (*Elective Course*): Computer Vision and (a little bit of) Deep Learning 👁 💻 🧠

## Information about the course

During this elective course, we used the knowledge from other elective courses like "Introduction to Data Science" and "Data Science":

- Python programming (data manipulation and visualization in NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib)
- Linux commands

By the end of the semester, we acquired the following competencies:

- Image manipulation and processing with OpenCV
- Correct use of Deep Learning algorithms
- Data augmentation and its purposes
- Use of Google Collaboratory
- and of course, our first **Self-Driving Car model** (either a Udacity Self-Driving Car or a *handmade Self-Driving Car*)

Dr. Enrique Camacho, a Physics Engineering graduate from the Autonomous University of Yucatan, teaches this elective course.

## Why am I doing this?

Since the day I finished my elective course "Data Science," I've been fascinated by its different applications in a variety of fields: Healthcare, Finance, Science (mainly in Biology and Physics) and Climate Change (I prefer the term *Climate Crisis*).

Computer Vision is a topic that intimidated me; however, the incredible applications and the beauty behind it encouraged me to take on the challenge and try my best and here's when the elective course "Self-Driving Cars" came into the game.

I love science (mainly physics), math and the broad field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I take this as part of my journey to discover and explore what I like and be good at doing.

I think I have a way to see and interpret the things I've learned, so the Jupyter Notebooks contain my understanding of the concept.

## Table of contents

### Part I: Road recognition (*Where am I heading?*) 🛣

In this section, I learned the necessary commands in OpenCV to identify the road and show the car's direction it is heading.

- **L01:** Basics of image manipulation ✅
- **L02:** Region of interest and direction algorithm ✅

### Part II: Object detection (*Watch out!*) 🚶 🚗 🚥

To identify and show where some objects are, we learned how to use the Haar Cascade Classifier in static images and videos.

- **L03:** Object detection (humans, cars, and stop signs) - work in progress... ⏳
- **L04:** Colour detection (traffic lights) - work in progress... ⏳

### Part III: Part I + Part II (*We are all in this together... 🎵*) 🚗 + 🛣 + 🚥 + 💻

This section contains the activity where I grabbed the commands and algorithms from the last blocks and put them together in one **.py** file.

- **L05:** Final result - work in progress... ⏳

### Part IV: Udacity Self-Driving Car (*using a neural network for our car*) 🚙

To learn one of the applications of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) we use the architecture for this kind of challenges... a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- **L06:** Udacity Self-Driving - work in progress...⏳

### Part V: YOLO (You Only Look Once 👀 )

Work in progress... ⏳

## Software requierments

### Software

- **Miniconda:** I use **Miniconda** as my primary package manager for Python. For more information, you can visit the following link. *[link](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)*
- **Google Colab:** With a Google account, you can freely access a Google Colab notebook and use Python and the many Data Science libraries without installing anything in your local computer because everything is in the cloud. For more information, watch the following *[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI)*

### Python Libraries

- **OpenCV** `pip install opencv-python` or `conda install opencv-python`
- **NumPy** `pip install numpy` or `conda install numpy`
- **Pandas** `pip install pandas` or `conda install pandas`
- **Matplotlib** `pip install matplotlib` or `conda install matplotlib`
