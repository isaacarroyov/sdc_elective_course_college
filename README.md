# Self-Driving Cars (_Elective Course_): Computer Vision and (a little bit of) Deep Learning üëÅ üíª üß†

## Information about the course
This course is aimed to use the knowledge we gain during the elective courses ‚ÄúIntroduction to Data Science‚Äù and ‚ÄúData Science‚Äù:
*	Python programming (data manipulation and visualization in: NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib)
*	Linux commands

By the end of the semester, we should have acquired the following competences:
* Image manipulation and processing with OpenCV
* Correct use of Deep Learning algorithms
*	Data augmentation and its purposes
*	Use of Google Collaboratory
*	and of course, have your first **Self-Driving Car model** (either a Udacity Self-Driving Car or a _handmade_ Self-Driving Car)

The course is thought by Dr. Enrique Camacho, Physics Engineering graduate from the Faculty of Engineering of the Autonomous University of Yucatan (FIUADY).

## Why am I doing this?
Since the day I finished (or even earlier) my elective course ‚ÄúData Science‚Äù I‚Äôve been fascinated by its different applications in a variety of fields: Healthcare, Finance, Science (mainly in Biology and Physics) and Climate Change (I prefer the term _Climate Crisis_).

Computer Vision is a topic that intimidated me but the incredible applications and the beauty behind it encouraged me to take on the challenge and try my best and here‚Äôs where the elective course ‚ÄúSelf-Driving Cars‚Äù came into the game.

I love science (specially Physics), math and the broad field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I take this as part of my journey discovering and exploring what can I bring to the world (and what I like).

I think I have a special way of seeing and interpreting the things I‚Äôve learned, so the Jupyter notebooks contain the way my understanding of the concept is.


## Table of contents
### Section I: Road recognition (_Where am I heading?_) üõ£
In this section I learned the necessary commands in OpenCV to identify the road and show the car's direction its heading.

* **L01:** Basics of image manipulation :white_check_mark:
* **L02:** Region of interest and direction algorithm :white_check_mark:

### Section II: Object detection (_Watch out!_) :walking: :red_car: :traffic_light:
In orden to identify and show the location of certain object we learn how to use the Haar Cascade Classifier in static images and in some videos.
* **L04:** Object detection (humans, cars and stop signs) - work in progress... :hourglass_flowing_sand:
* **L05:** Colour detection (traffic lights) - work in progress... :hourglass_flowing_sand:

### Section III: Section I + Section II (_We are all in this together... :musical_note:_) :red_car: + üõ£ + :traffic_light: + :computer:
This section contains the activity where I grab the commands and algorithms  from the past sections and put it all together in one **.py** file.
* **L07:** Final result - work in progress... :hourglass_flowing_sand:

### Section IV: Udacity Self-Driving Car (_using a neural network for our car_) :blue_car:
In order to learn one of the applications of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) we use the architecture for this kind of challenges... a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* **L08:** Udacity Self-Driving - work in progress...:hourglass_flowing_sand:

### Section V:  Remote Self-Driving Car
Work in progress... :hourglass_flowing_sand:

## Software requirements
* **Software**
  * **Miniconda:** I personally use **Miniconda** as my main Python's package manager. For more information you can visit the following [_link_](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
  * **Google Colab:** With a Google account you can access freely to a Google Colab notebook and use Python and the many Data Science libraries without installing anything in your local computer, everything in the cloud. For more information watch the following [_video_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI)
* **Python Libraries**
  * OpenCV `pip install opencv-python`
  * NumPy `pip install numpy`
  * Pandas `pip install pandas`
  * Matplotlib `pip install matplotlib`
